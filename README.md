"Give a man a fish and you'll feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you'll feed him for a lifetime" - Confucius

This project was designed to compare the retail prices of 4 types of fish - hake, tuna, sardines and pilchards - from 4 major
South African grocery retailers - Pick'N'Pay, Spar, Checkers and Food Lover's Market as a data analysis exercise.

The technology used is Anaconda 3 operating in a virtual environment, using Python 3.12 and the development environment is Linux.
No databases were illegally accessed, nor was any of the data gathered using ANY form of scraping - all of the data gathered was 
from publicly available sources.
